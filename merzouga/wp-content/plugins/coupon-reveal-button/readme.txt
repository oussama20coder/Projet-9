Customize your coupon reveal with your own color scheme and easily manage, use and re-use all your coupon- and/or bonus code reveal buttons on any page with this WordPress coupon plugin.

Most affiliate websites use coupon codes and discount codes to generate revenue in a simple and modern way. 
Users often end up getting the discount code, without clicking an affiliate link. We have solved that through this coupon code reveal button, once the user click the button they are redirected to the affiliate link, while being shown the discount code. 

Use our button generator to create coupon reveal buttons and display them through shortcodes with the new Gutenberg block for shortcodes. You can also add it to widgets or any other text editor you prefer.

After a user click the button an animation happens and a more minimal button is shown with the coupon code revealed on it.
The buttons generated are lightweight, SEO optimized, fast and responsive.  

The button that is shown on your site is built with minimal code using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

== Made for affiliates advertisement == 

Are you a member of affiliate programs & or perhaps run your own network of websites that earn money on outgoing upsell backlinks to third party websites? Then this plugin is made for you! It's great for increasing your conversion rate because it forces your visitors to click your affiliate links before they can see the bonus code / discount code, so they get your affilaite cookie in their browser. You can optionally select the links to be rel="nofollow" (Which means it won't pass any link juice). Using nofollow links is normal when it comes to affiliate marketing, so is URL cloaking / short URL so Google don't can't tell that it's an affiliate link.

That's why you often see websites have www.mywebsite.com/goto/affiliate-link instead of www.mypartnerswebsite.com=102019292. It's very common for coupons and promo code websites. We also have a target="_blank" feature, but be careful because some Google Chrome AD blockers will see it as an ad, so the affiliate link won't work.

We were inspired by websites like RetailMeNot, SlickDeals, Groupon, etc. who has the click to copy/reveal functionality, provide coupon details/expirations, and lots more.
